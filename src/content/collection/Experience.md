### My Experience

Currently, I am studying Computer Science at the University of La Frontera, Chile. As a result, I have not yet had the opportunity to engage in a professional work environment. However, I have been gradually honing my skills by developing personal projects. These range from experimental endeavors to more sophisticated and serious development efforts.
